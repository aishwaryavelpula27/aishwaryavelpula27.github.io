## overview

Check Out My New Online Portfolio!

I'm excited to share my brand-new professional website, which I built and launched on GitHub Pages! It's more than just a resume; it's a dynamic showcase of my web development abilities. You'll find all my background info, plus some cool interactive touches like working clocks and a neat email reveal â€“ all powered by JavaScript. I even hooked it up to some public APIs to pull in fun jokes and interesting images automatically! To make it super user-friendly, it remembers you with cookies and even tracks visits. I really think it highlights my skills for anyone looking for a developer.
